Hello there! 

I'm <b>Rodolfo</b>, and I'm a <b>Technical Artist</b> currently working at [Monomi Park] on [Slime Rancher 2]. I've been working in the industry for the past 5 years and I'm extremely motivated by empowering artists and making cool stuff. I have a huge affinity for understanding more about rendering, with a special place for environments, lighting and VFX.
<br><br>
I believe a lot in the potential of games bring to the world as an interactive medium, and my vision for TA is that studying these tools and techniques help me become a better artist, and help the team get closer to achieving their vision for the art in a project.
<br><br>
The goal of this website is to serve as both a portfolio and a hub to share some knowledge and impressions about gamedev, and help others who are interested in learning more about TA.
<br><br>

My specialties include:

- Shader development (HLSL, GLSL)
- VFX Creation (Shuriken, Niagara)
- 3D Modeling (Maya, ZBrush)
- Coding (C#)
- 2D Asset Creation (Substance Designer, Photoshop)
- UI Integration (UGUI, UMG)

For more information, please check my [Resume].
